MORE TELL DOn't SHOW! :)

080325 AND 090325 WHEN COMPILING DB, FIX THESE. IS TIME WHEN FCST WANT RECORDING.

put a crown on something, make it more visible, reputation, show if theyre normally good
rainbow of grades, put on logo?

COLOUR OF PINS, MAKE IT STRIKING: PICK COL FROM MO OR BBC, WHICHEVER FURTHEST FROM MIDDLE (C?)
NEED TO LOOK AT ACCESSIBILITY (ARIA)

LOOK AT OWMOBS, IS IT WRONG TIME? DOING .fromtimestamp WHENS AVING TO JSON.

fix trackpad scrolling on main page.

LOOK AT BOOKMARKS: MO "HOW ACCURATE ARE PUBLIC FOECASTS"
if editing __main__, in xml save nicely value editor, change to:
v = v.replace("erly","").lower().replace(" ","") # !!
bbc has been doing last_times all this time. bcs of that we have duplicates and batch_times == data_date. badbadbad!

bbc in general, wts are qualitative, not quantitative

make letter grades per part of forecast, then per forecast = mean/mode of letters
per day = mean/mode of letters of forecasts, this can be compared to only daily (bbc)
three hourly forecasts, dont try to interpolate, just have the 8 occurences per day be for the summary. can eb any number.

MO daily is pointless, less than a week and three hourly is more than a week.

LOOK AT WIND GUST SPEEDS
LOOK AT RAIN RATES OBS VS FCST, IS OBS ALWAYS HIGHER?

precip_rt is always mm/h, from owm and mofcst :)

vps needed? for backend code, frontend could just run on github pages.

chose innertube style because its easier for flow, inspo from youtube!!

HOW TO MAKE SITE ACCESSIBLE!!!!

rounded wind d to nearest comp[ass point

look at aws
